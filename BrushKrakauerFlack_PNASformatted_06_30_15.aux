The error rate of a pair using Nash equilibrium thresholds increases as the weight given to either decision time or decision preference increases. In (a)-(d) the lines show the Nash equilibrium thresholds for a pair of animals as a function of the difficulty of the decision ($c$). The optimization weights for each panel are indicated in the simplex with the corresponding letter. In (e) the color indicates the error rate of a decision made by a pair making a difficult decision ($c=.55$) using Nash equilibrium thresholds, as a function of the optimization weights, $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$. In the lower left corner of the simplex, only error rate matters ($w_1=1$). In the upper corner, only decision time matters ($w_2=1$). In the lower right corner, only preference matters ($w_3=1$). Parameters: $w_1=1$, $w_2=0$, $w_3=0$ (a), $w_1=0$, $w_2=0$, $w_3=1$ (b), $w_1=0$, $w_2=0.2$, $w_3=0.8$ (c), $w_1=0$, $w_2=0$, $w_3=1$ (d), $b=1$, $r=1$, $\ell =0.1$ in all panels. }}{7}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces  The error rate of a group using Nash thresholds decreases as the weight given to decision preference increases, as long as there are non-zero waiting costs. In (a) the points show the average Nash thresholds as a function of position in the group for different optimization weights, where $1$ is the strongest individual and $20$ is the weakest. The shaded region shows the average plus or minus the standard deviation across $1000$ draws of values. The optimization weights for each panel are indicated in the simplex with the corresponding letter. The color in the simplices indicates, in (b), the average error rate of the whole group, and, in (c), the average error rate of the decisions made by individuals in the bottom quartile of the group, as a function of the optimization weights, $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$. In the lower left corner of the simplex, only error rate matters ($w_1=1$). In the upper corner, only decision time matters ($w_2=1$). In the lower right corner, only preference matters ($w_3=1$). In (d)-(g) the color indicates the expected time it takes each pair of components to reach a decision in a group using Nash thresholds. Parameters: $w_1=1$, $w_2=0$, $w_3=0$ (i), $w_1=0$, $w_2=0$, $w_3=1$ (ii), $w_1=0.9$, $w_2=0.1$, $w_3=0$ (iii), $w_1=0$, $w_2=0.1$, $w_3=0.9$ (iv), $N=20$, $b=1$, $r=1$, $\ell =0.1$ in all panels. }}{7}}
